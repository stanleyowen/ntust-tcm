              The materials used to make acupuncture needles have changed greatly over time,
              reflecting both technological progress and deeper medical understanding. Each stage of
              this evolution—from sharp stones in the Neolithic Age to stainless steel in modern
              clinics—shows how people found new ways to improve healing with the tools they had.

              Neolithic Age (around 10,000 - 2000 BCE): Natural Materials and Early Tools
            </MKTypography>
            <MKTypography variant="body2" color="text" sx={{ textAlign: "justify" }} mb={3}>
              In the very beginning, long before written records, ancient humans relied on what
              nature provided. During the Neolithic Age, people discovered that sharp stones, later
              called Bain Stones (砭石), could be used to treat illnesses and relieve pain. These
              tools were used to cut open abscesses or stimulate the skin, similar to how
              acupuncture is practiced today. These stones weren't needles as we know them, but they
              were the starting point of the idea—that stimulating certain points on the body could
              help with healing. Later on, bone needles made from animal bones appeared. These tools
              were sharper and easier to shape than stone, making them more effective and less
              painful to use. Bamboo needles were also introduced during this time. Bamboo was more
              flexible than stone or bone and could be shaped into fine points. These early tools
              helped ancient healers experiment and begin to understand which body parts responded
              to pressure or poking.

            <MKTypography variant="body2" color="text" sx={{ textAlign: "justify" }} mb={3}>
              With the arrival of the Shang Dynasty, Chinese society entered the Bronze Age,
              bringing new materials and improved tools. This period saw the creation of bronze
              needles, which were more durable and precise than earlier stone or bone versions.
              Bronze could be shaped into thin, smooth points, allowing practitioners to insert them
              with greater accuracy. The invention of the Chinese character for "needle" (針) during
              this era reflects how important acupuncture was becoming as a medical practice.

            <MKTypography variant="body2" color="text" sx={{ textAlign: "justify" }} mb={3}>
              As time passed, especially during the Spring and Autumn Period, iron needles began to
              replace bronze. Iron was even stronger and could be made into finer, more consistent
              shapes. This allowed for deeper needling and more advanced techniques. Iron needles
              were a major step forward, especially as acupuncture began to spread and develop into
              a more systematized form of medicine.

              In later historical periods, acupuncture needles were also made from silver and gold.
              These materials were not only symbols of wealth but were believed to have specific
              healing properties.

                Just as the materials and shapes of acupuncture needles have evolved to become
                finer, more precise, and more effective over time, a similar transformation has
                occurred in the world of modern technology—especially in integrated circuit (IC)
                design. In electronics, engineers have worked for decades to make circuits smaller
                and thinner while increasing their power and efficiency, leading to the powerful yet
                tiny chips we use today in smartphones and computers. This idea of "doing more with
                less" parallels the development of acupuncture: from large, rough stone tools to
                ultra-thin stainless steel needles that can treat the body with minimal discomfort.
                Both journeys show how advancing material science and precision engineering can
                enhance performance—whether in healing the human body or powering modern devices.
                The continued miniaturization of tools in both fields reflects a shared goal: to
                improve outcomes through precision, innovation, and thoughtful design.
