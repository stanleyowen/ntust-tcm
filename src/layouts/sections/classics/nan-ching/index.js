              The Classic of Nan-Ching, also known as the Nan Jing (難經) or The Classic of
              Difficult Issues, is one of the most important books in the history of Traditional
              Chinese Medicine (TCM). Its full name is Huangdi Bashiyi Nan Jing (黃帝八十一難經),
              which means “The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Eighty-One Difficult Issues.”
            </MKTypography>

            <MKTypography variant="body2" color="text" sx={{ textAlign: "justify" }} mb={3}>
              This book was written a long time ago, most likely in the first century CE, during or
              just after the Han dynasty in China. Although we don't know exactly who wrote it, the
              ideas inside the book have had a major influence on how Chinese medicine is practiced,
              not just in China but also in places like Japan, where it became a key reference in
              Japanese acupuncture and traditional Japanese medicine (TJM).

              Why is it called the Classic of "Difficult Issues"?
            </MKTypography>

            <MKTypography variant="body2" color="text" sx={{ textAlign: "justify" }} mb={3}>
              The Nan Jing is made up of 81 chapters, and each one tries to answer a “difficult
              question” that was unclear or confusing in another famous medical book: the Huangdi
              Neijing (黃帝內經), or Yellow Emperor’s Inner Classic. The Neijing was the first great
              book of Chinese medicine, but some parts of it were hard to understand. The Nan Jing
              was written to help explain those tricky parts more clearly.

            <MKTypography variant="body2" color="text" sx={{ textAlign: "justify" }} mb={3}>
              The Nan Jing is written in a question-and-answer format, just like a conversation
              between a student and a wise teacher. Each chapter focuses on one important issue in
              Chinese medicine and gives a detailed explanation.

              The Nan Jing covers many important topics in Chinese medicine, especially things that
              were not fully explained in the Neijing. These include:
