              The Shen Nong Bencao Jing, also known as The Divine Farmer's Classic of Materia
              Medica, is the oldest known Chinese book on medicinal substances. It is traditionally
              attributed to the mythical figure Shen Nong (神農), considered the inventor of herbal
              medicine in Chinese legend. However, the real author is unknown, and the text was
              likely compiled during the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE) or even earlier in the
              Warring States period.

              Although the original book was lost during the Tang dynasty, large parts of it were
              preserved through quotations in later texts and reconstructed by scholars, especially
              during the Ming and Qing periods. The best-known version today is the one revised by
              Tao Hongjing (陶弘景).

              The Shen Nong Bencao Jing is divided into three volumes (juan) and describes 365
              medicinal substances, which include:

              The book also explains how herbs interact through the concept of “seven affects”
              (七情)—whether they support, oppose, or neutralize each other. It includes information
              on the five flavors (sour, salty, sweet, bitter, spicy) and four energies (hot, warm,
              cool, cold), crucial in Traditional Chinese Medicine for balancing Yin and Yang in the
              body.
